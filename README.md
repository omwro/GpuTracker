This repository is a NodeJs script originally created for educational purposes.

The purpose of this script is to stock watch certain products from a support webshop.
The stocks are collected by opening a browser tab in Puppeteer and scrape the HTML element
resposible for showing the stock status. 
If the webshop is fully supported, it is able to add the item to the cart, fill in the credentials 
and select the payment method. 
The only manual action would be to pay for the order and that is it.
